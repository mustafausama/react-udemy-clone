By the time you finish this course, you'll be an <strong>absolute pro</strong> at programming!</p><p>This course will cover <strong>all the basics</strong> and <strong>several advanced concepts</strong> of Python. We’ll go over:</p><ul><li><p>The fundamentals of Python programming</p></li><li><p>Writing and Reading to Files</p></li><li><p>Automation of Word and Excel Files</p></li><li><p>Web scraping with BeautifulSoup4</p></li><li><p>Browser automation with Selenium</p></li><li><p>Data Analysis and Visualization with MatPlotLib</p></li><li><p>Regex parsing and Task Management</p></li><li><p>GUI and Gaming with Tkinter</p></li><li><p>And much more!</p></li></ul><p>If you read the above list and are feeling a bit confused, don’t worry! As an instructor and student on Udemy for <strong>almost 4 years,</strong> I know what it’s like to be overwhelmed with boring and mundane. I promise you’ll have a blast learning the ins and outs of python. I’ve successfully taught over<strong> 200,000+ students </strong>from over<strong> 200 countries</strong> jumpstart their programming journeys through my courses. </p><p>Here’s what some of my students have to say:</p><ul><li><p>“I wish I started programming at a younger age like Avi. &nbsp;This Python course was excellent for those that cringe at the thought of starting over from scratch with attempts to write programs once again. Python is a great building language for any beginner programmer. Thank you Avi!”</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>“I had no idea about any programming language. With Avi's lectures, I'm now aware of several python concepts and I'm beginning to write my own programs. Avi is crisp and clear in his lectures and it is easy to catch the concepts and the depth of it through his explanations. Thanks, Avi for the wonderful course, You're awesome! It's helping me a lot :)”</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>\"Videos are short and concise and well-defined in their title, this makes them easy to refer back to when a refresher is needed. Explanations aren't convoluted with complicated examples, which adds to the quick pace of the videos. I am very pleased with the decision to enroll in this course. Not only has it increased the pace I'm learning Python but I actively look forward to continuing the course, whenever I get the chance. Avi is friendly and energetic, absolutely delightful as an instructor.”</p></li></ul><p>So what are you waiting for? <strong>Jumpstart your programming journey</strong> and dive into the world of Python by<strong> enrolling in this course today!</strong></p>",

Python is super easy to learn but very powerful since it contains many possibilities.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Python is growing faster and faster everyday and it has surpassed many other languages over the years for a lot of reasons, which you will find out soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why take this course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course starts with explaining what programming really is? Have you ever wondered how things actually work in a program?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Teaches the foundation of GENERAL programming</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Every student should have some foundations on what programming really is before learning any language, why? Because once you understand the core components of programming it will be a lot easier to learn any language and create better programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>New lectures added all the time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you like what you do, it reflects. This is not a job for me, so I wake up wanting to code and help my students. Basically you pay once, get the course forever and get extra values added all the time, you have to love that :)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong> Fun place to be </strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I love making my lectures fun and engaging, so no boring lectures here!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>T</strong><strong>he support you get in this course in unmatched</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>have you ever joined a class and received very little support or none at all?

This course is designed for users that already have a basic working knowledge of Python.</p><p>You will start by learning about classes, including defining a class, class attributes, and working with class and instance data. From there, David will teach you about inheritance and polymorphism. This video tutorial also covers advanced features, such as implementing core syntax, subclassing built-ins, and new style classes. You will also learn about exceptions and object serialization. Finally, David will teach you about efficiency and testing, including debugging, logging, and benchmarking.</p><p>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of designing your own Python classes, as well as implementing object-oriented programming concepts in Python. </p>",

I'm on the 6th section now and I stumbled on the 5th (it was a little unclear to me),.. but I have yet to find a course that is so professional and thorough. There are intricacies to python that just cannot be learned in a classroom, and I have been to more than my fair share. This instructor is phenomenal in his coverage of intermediate/advanced python. I have to give it 5 stars."

          "content": "This course contains a good depth and breadth of OOP. The theme of the programs within is collaborative; i.e. writing code intended to be easily understood, inherited, encapsulated, and/or overridden by another programmer-in-league. I found this instrumental in better understanding objects and instances, and even built-ins and their attributes. The assignments start off a little easy, but by the end you are building custom exceptions and writing tests for your scripts. Highly recommend for those that have made it through one or several Python tutorials (I started with Learn Python the Hard Way) and looking to better understand classes and what OOP is all about."
